# Color Picker

This repository helps to generate large sets of attractive and accessible color schemes based on Mathew Strom's work in [*How to pick the least wrong colors*](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/how-to-pick-the-least-wrong-colors).

## Description

This code is, in many cases, a direct NodeJS-to-Python port of Mathew Strom's work in [*How to pick the least wrong colors*](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/how-to-pick-the-least-wrong-colors). I have made minor improvements in certain areas.

`target_colors` is an array of colors in hexadecimal format. If set, the script will attempt to find colors that are similar to these.

`energy_weight`, `range_weight`, `target_weight`, `protanopia_weight`, `deuteranopia_weight`, and `tritanopia_weight` can be any floating point number. They adjust the relative impact of each factor in the algorithm's decisionmaking:

- A higher energy weight (`energy_weight`) will result in colors that are more differentiable from each other.
- A higher range weight (`range_weight`) will result in colors that are more uniformly spread through color space.
- A higher target weight (`target_weight`) will result in colors that are closer to the target colors specified with `target_colors`.
- A higher protanopia weight (`protanopia_weight`) will result in colors that are more differentiable to people with protanopia.
- A higher deuteranopia weight (`deuteranopia_weight`) will result in colors that are more differentiable to people with deuteranopia.
- A higher tritanopia weight (`tritanopia_weight`) will result in colors that are more differentiable to people with tritanopia.

`temperature` can be any floating point number. It is the starting point temperature of the algorithm - a higher temperature means that early iterations are more likely to be randomly-chosen than optimized.

`cooling_rate` can be any floating point number. It is the decrease in temperature at each iteration. A lower cooling rate will result in more iterations.

`cutoff` is the temperature at which the algorithm will stop optimizing and return results. A lower cutoff means more late-stage iterations where improvements are minimal.

## Background and Motivation

Mathew Strom made a good case for this project in [*How to pick the least wrong colors*](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/how-to-pick-the-least-wrong-colors), so I won't belabor the point here.
